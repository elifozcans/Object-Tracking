# Object Tracking
 Object Tracking Project
 
 #Simple object tracking with OpenCV
I will show how to use Object Tracking by using OpenCV library in Python.

In this project I will use some files:

1) Some videos of the area where I will use to count the vehicles and people.
2) tracker files. This has already been written and you can simply download it
3) python files.  I will proceed step by step with the integration of the libraries

What are the possible applications?
The possible applications are different for example, counting how many people are in a certain area, checking how many objects pass on a conveyor belt, or counting the vehicles on a highway.
